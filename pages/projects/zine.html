        <p class="body1 bodyColumn">Throughout mankind’s history, technology has advanced exponentially—resulting in significant improvements regarding how we live, function, and think as individuals and as a society. The emergence of the Internet, for instance, has enabled individuals from all walks of life to connect with one-another virtually—resulting in more diverse communities; the implementation of technology in the medical field has, and will continue to save the lives of both humans and animals; and our understanding of consciousness will expand significantly with the help of robotics. Although modern-day technology has made life for the average individual more comfortable, safe, and convenient. Advances in technology will help mankind become ethically stronger as both a society and a species.</p>
