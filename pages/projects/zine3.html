        <p class="body1 bodyColumn">Medical research and development profit considerably from emerging technologies; The American Society of Mechanical Engineers, states there are six main uses for robotics in modern medicine: telepresence (appointments and check-ups via online connection), surgical assistants, rehabilitation robots, medical transportation robots, sanitation and disinfection robots, and robotic prescription dispensing systems. Telecommunication is, perhaps, the most applied benefit due to the Coronavirus pandemic. According to the article, “Physicians use robots to help them examine and treat patients in rural or remote locations, giving them a ‘telepresence’ in the room,” where they can effectively communicate with a patient and answer any questions he or she may have. Additionally, surgical assistants help surgeons successfully perform minimally invasive procedures, alongside medical transportation robots—which deliver food, water, and medication to patients and staff in need. Communication between doctors happens much more efficiently, which is crucial when it comes to life-or-death situations. Rehabilitation in the medical field is continually improving, mainly thanks to modern-day technology; victims of traumatic brain injury, for example, often seek help from robots programmed to accommodate each individual’s process of rehabilitation to best suit their needs. Sanitation and disinfecting robots are much more successful than their human counterparts at eliminating antibiotic-resistant bacteria; these robots are also able to avoid contracting deadly viruses considering they have no internal organs. In terms of ethics, it is infinitely more humane to expose machinery to a deadly virus than to risk any further human contraction. Finally—due to a machine’s precise accuracy and uncontested speed, pharmacies already utilize advanced technology to automate the process of dispensing pharmaceutical drugs—bypassing human error.</p>
