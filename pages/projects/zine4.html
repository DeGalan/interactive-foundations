        <p class="body1 bodyColumn">Robots are also highly beneficial in regards to animal welfare and rights. Although medically advantageous to mankind, animal experimentation presents an ethical nightmare that exceeds the realm of triviality. In standard cosmetic, medical, and toxicological testing, millions of animals suffer extraordinary amounts of pain and suffering in the name of science. No matter how groundbreaking scientific research is for humanity, it is cruel, expensive, and somewhat unreliable. Replacing fully-conscious non-human animals with robots is a promising alternative to animal testing in all shapes and forms—from cosmetics, to biomedical research, and even toxicology testing. As David Grimm addresses in his article, <i>Record number of monkeys being used in U.S. research,</i> “The number of monkeys used in U.S. biomedical research reached an all-time high [in 2017], according to data released in late September by the U.S. Department of Agriculture.” Animals are incapable of consenting to painful and invasive experimentation; therefore, the usage of nonhuman animals in any type of research is completely immoral and discriminatory. Utilizing modern-day technology to reduce and replace animal testing is the only morally acceptable way to make meaningful progress. Furthermore, Pew Research concludes, “The U.S. public is closely divided when it comes to the use of animals in scientific research. Some 47% favor the practice, while 52% oppose it…” The use of animals in research, as shown, appears to be a practice the majority of individuals asked disagree with; continuing to use a method the general public disapproves of also presents an issue regarding morality, as a true free and democratic society has an obligation to listen to its people.</p>
