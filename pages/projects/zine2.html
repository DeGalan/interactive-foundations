        <p class="body1 bodyColumn">The more society progresses in regards to technology, the more self-aware and understanding mankind seems to become. Acceptance of marginalized groups has increased alongside the growth and implementation of technology. Acknowledging our differences has never been easier, as a message is capable of reaching people from all walks of life; The Internet exposes the masses to a plethora of unique cultures, groups, perspectives, and opinions from all around the world—and does so in a way that is nearly impossible to censor. Traditional forms of communication have a financial obligation to only broadcast information which benefits them, which results in dissenting opinions being dismissed and censored. Since the rise of the Internet and the invention of more efficient technology, it has become increasingly difficult to withhold important information from the general public. With this newfound knowledge, we learn to reconsider our views and biases, granting us all the freedom to openly challenge societal ‘norms’. As mentioned by the Center of Democracy and Technology in 2015, “The tech industry rallying together to support America’s LGBT community means far more than just protecting business . . . It is also an important reminder of the profound impact that technology and the Internet have on the lives of minority, marginalized, and repressed communities, including the diverse LGBT community.” The globalization of information—made possible via modern-day technology—empowers minority voices and promotes equality, understanding, and tolerance. The decentralization of information made possible by the online world provides a public platform for anyone and everyone to use. This, however, is only one benefit reaped from technological progression.</p>
